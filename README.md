This program is a minimal wrapper around [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) to support multiple panes in the terminal window.

Copy the source file [`panes`](https://github.com/jimmymathews/panes/blob/main/panes) to a location somewhere on your path. The file name is up to you.

Install:
```sh
panes install
```

Use `panes --help` or `panes help` to see usage examples.

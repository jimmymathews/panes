This program is an extremely minimal wrapper around [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) to support multiple panes in the terminal window.

Copy the source file [`panes`](https://github.com/jimmymathews/panes/blob/main/panes) to a location somewhere on your path. The file name is up to you.

Then:
```sh
panes install
```

Use `panes --help` or `panes help` to see usage examples.

- Start
  ![i1](screencap1.png)
-  Make a new pane
  ![i2](screencap2.png)
- Enter commands in new panes
